<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>
AO 0235+164 (z=0.94) is one of the most variable quasars emitting in 
spectral bands from radio to gamma. It demonstrates extremely compact 
morphology and complex kinematics which are still purely understood.

Base of a jet observed by cm-wavelength VLBI - the core - 
is a surface of unit optical depth with respect to synchrotron self-absorption. 
Size and position of the core depend on frequency. When a disturbance propagating 
downstream the jet crosses the core, the flare peak on a given frequency is observed. 
Time lags and core position measurements on different frequencies give independent 
estimates of jet speed. Moreover, variability time scale measured along with the 
size of a VLBI component provide an estimates of intrinsic brightness temperature 
and Doppler factor.
