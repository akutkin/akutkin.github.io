<h1>Time lags and core size frequency dependence</h1>
<p>
For the G-flare we found that both time lags (ΔT) and core size (W) depend on frequency 
as ν<sup>-0.9</sup>. 
The core is resolved at all frequencies and has elliptical form with mean axes ratio ~0.5. 
The jet opening speed is then ~3 mas/yr implying a huge observed opening angle (~180<sup>o</sup>) if 
compared to the component speed (0.24 mas/yr). This may be explained if the intrinsic jet 
half-opening angle is higher than viewing angle φ/2 > θ. The further analysis supports such 
a scenario.
