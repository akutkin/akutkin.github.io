<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
AO 0235+164 (z=0.94) is one of the most variable quasars emitting in 
spectral bands from radio to gamma. It demonstrates extremely compact 
morphology and complex kinematics which are still purely understood.
</p>
<p>
Base of a jet observed by cm-wavelength VLBI - the core - 
is a surface of unit optical depth with respect to synchrotron self-absorption. 
Size and position of the core depend on frequency. When a disturbance propagating 
downstream the jet crosses the core, the flare peak on a given frequency is observed. 
Time lags and core position measurements on different frequencies give independent 
estimates of jet speed. Moreover, variability time scale measured along with the 
size of a VLBI component provide an estimates of intrinsic brightness temperature 
and Doppler factor.
</p>

<p>
We model and analyze its VLBI structure in each band/epoch to trace the evolution of brightness temperature, 
estimate Doppler factor, viewing and opening angles of the jet, as well as its speed in the core region and 
at the superluminal component during the flare in late 2008. We find an evidence for outflow acceleration and 
collimation within 1 mas of the core which can explain the complex dual-sided jet pointing. Extremely high 
brightness temperatures  >10<sup>13</sup>K measured with Radioastron indicate presence of unresolved core substructure.

Peak-to-peak variability time lags of the flares on different 
frequencies are found using Gaussian process regression with 
squared-exponential kernel.

<p>12 epochs from Dec 2012 till Jan 2016. Bands: 1.6 (L), 4.6 (C) and 22 GHz (K). Fringes detected up to 14 Gλ baseline (15 Earth diameters in K-band) withASC correlator. Fringe fitting and amplitude calibrations are performed using <a href=http://astrogeo.org/pima>PIMA</a>. 
The brightness temperatures are estimated by fitting the visibility amplitudes with a circular 
gaussian, and the lower limits are obtained from visibility amplitude on longest baselines [Lobanov 2015].

<h2><a name="lags"></a>Time lags and core size</h2>
<p>
For the G-flare we found that both time lags (ΔT) and core size (W) depend on frequency 
as ν<sup>-0.9</sup>. 
The core is resolved at all frequencies and has elliptical form with mean axes ratio ~0.5. 
The jet opening speed is then ~3 mas/yr implying a huge observed opening angle (~180<sup>o</sup>) if 
compared to the component speed (0.24 mas/yr). This may be explained if the intrinsic jet 
half-opening angle is higher than viewing angle φ/2 &gt; θ. The further analysis supports such 
a scenario.
</p>

<h2><a name="jet"></a>Jet geometry and kinematics</h2>
<p>
The G-flare is accompanied by a bright feature, moving non-ballistically at ~ 0.2 mas 
southwards of the core. Its apparent proper motion is μ<sub>app</sub>=0.24 mas/yr (β<sub>app</sub>= 12c) and acceleration ~0.2 mas/yr. Using VLBI size along with single dish time scale measurements, we estimate the Doppler factors of 
the core (10) and component (30). The viewing angle and Lorentz factor of the component: θ=1.2<sup>o</sup> and Γ=18. 
If θ is preserved, the jet in the core region is much slower (Γ~5) and  undergoes an acceleration downstream.
We also consider a case when viewing angle is changed. 
</p>
<p>
In spite of extreme compactness we were able to estimate the observed jet opening angle φ<sub>obs</sub>=65<sup>o</sup> 
within 0.6-0.7 mas along ridgeline using stacked 43 GHz map. This is two times higher than seen at 2 cm (30<sup>o</sup>, Pushkarev+ 2017) 
implying significant jet collimation. The extended jet is propagating northwards of the core while the component is observed ~180<sup>o</sup> opposite. 
We interpret this as a transition of intrinsic jet opening angle value from φ &gt; 2θ to φ &lt; 2θ due to collimation. 
This agrees well with obtained θ=1.2<sup>o</sup>, φ<sub>43GHz</sub>=1.36<sup>o</sup>, φ<sub>15GHz</sub>=0.62<sup>o</sup>
and with flow acceleration within 1 mas of the core.
</p>

<h2><a name="temp"></a>Brightness temperature</h2>
<p>
The brightness temperature measured using ground-based VLBI increases by a factor ~2 
during the flares, but still is much lower than one obtained with the space interferometer. 
Significant visibility amplitudes on bases up to 14 Gλ suggest that the innermost core 
structure is more complex and can not be fully explained by single gaussian-shaped model. 
Most likely there are blobs or shocks residing along the jet (core major axis), and separated 
by very small angular distance. Presence of such ultra-compact structures has been found in 
cores of several quasars with Radioastron (e.g. Gomez+ 2016). Evidence also follows from fast 
variability detected in the source (e.g. Romero+ 2000).
