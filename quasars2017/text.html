<h1><a name="intro"></a>Intro</h1>
<p>
AO 0235+164 (z=0.94) is one of the most variable quasars emitting in 
spectral bands from radio to gamma. It demonstrates extremely compact 
morphology and complex kinematics which are still purely understood.
</p>
<p>
Base of a jet observed by cm-wavelength VLBI - the core - 
is a surface of unit optical depth with respect to synchrotron self-absorption. 
Size and position of the core depend on frequency. When a disturbance propagating 
downstream the jet crosses the core, the flare peak on a given frequency is observed. 
Time lags and core position measurements on different frequencies give independent 
estimates of jet speed. Moreover, variability time scale measured along with the 
size of a VLBI component provide an estimates of intrinsic brightness temperature 
and Doppler factor.

<ul><li> <a href=http://lsa.umich.edu/astro> Michigan University Radio Observatory</a> (UMRAO) at 5, 8 and 15 GHz </li><li> <a href=http://metsahovi.aalto.fi/en/> Metsahovi Radio Observatory</a> at 22 and 37 GHz </li><li> <a href=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ovroblazars/> Owens Valley Radio Observatory</a> (OVRO) at 15 GHz </li></ul>

<p>
Peak-to-peak variability time lags of the flares on different 
frequencies are found using Gaussian process regression with 
squared-exponential kernel.

<ul><li> BK150 (2008-09-02): VLBA; 4.8 - 43 GHz </li><li> EK028 (2008-10-19): BD, ON, WB, MC, EF, TR, SV, ZC, HH, SH, UR, NT, JB; 1.6 - 8.4 GHz </li>

Calibrations are performed using AIPS, Difmap.The source structure is modeled in Difmap with elliptical and circular gaussian components (core+jet).

blazar group. 100 epochs from Jun 2007 till Jul 2016 are analyzed. The source structure is modeled in Difmap with elliptical and circular gaussian components (core+jet).

<p>12 epochs from Dec 2012 till Jan 2016. Bands: 1.6 (L), 4.6 (C) and 22 GHz (K). Fringes detected up to 14 Gλ baseline (15D⨁ in K-band) withASC correlator. Fringe fitting and amplitude calibrations are performed using <a href=http://astrogeo.org/pima>PIMA</a>. 
The brightness temperatures are estimated by fitting the visibility amplitudes with a circular 
gaussian, and the lower limits are obtained from visibility amplitude on longest baselines [Lobanov 2015].

<h1><a name="lags"></a>Time lags and core size frequency dependence</h1>
<p>
For the G-flare we found that both time lags (ΔT) and core size (W) depend on frequency 
as ν<sup>-0.9</sup>. 
The core is resolved at all frequencies and has elliptical form with mean axes ratio ~0.5. 
The jet opening speed is then ~3 mas/yr implying a huge observed opening angle (~180<sup>o</sup>) if 
compared to the component speed (0.24 mas/yr). This may be explained if the intrinsic jet 
half-opening angle is higher than viewing angle φ/2 > θ. The further analysis supports such 
a scenario.
